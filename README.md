The display of sensor values ​​(e.g. Bed Status, Heartbeat Rate, Motion Sensor, Presence Sensor, Respiratory Rate, and Sleep Quality) in Home Assistant can be described as follows:
1. Bed Status: A value of 0 means no "Out of Bed" status is detected. A value of 1 means "In Bed".
2. Heartbeat Rate: Displays the heart rate of a person in the area that the sensor can detect (in BPM: Beats Per Minute). A value of 67 means a normal heart rate.
3. Motion Sensor: A value of 1 means movement is detected in the area covered by the sensor. A value of 0 means there is no movement.
4. Presence Sensor: A value of 1 means there is a person in the area that the sensor can detect. A value of 0 means there is no person in the area.
5. Respiratory Rate: A value of 16 means the respiratory rate of a person in the area (in RPM: Respirations Per Minute).
6. Sleep Quality: A value of 0 means there is no information about sleep quality. This value may require additional calculations (or data from additional sensors) to obtain an accurate value.

## Installation
Download the file in header : r60abd1_sensor.h and copy it to esphome (/homeassistant/esphome/header/r60abd1_sensor.h) in your main Home Assistant config/esphome folder
```
/header/r60abd1_sensor.h
```
In the Home Assistant add-on, click ESPHome > Open the web GUI and create a new device by selecting the "Continue" option and giving it a name, e.g.: Then paste the code: r60abd1-espc6-sensor.yaml and edit it.
```
```
R60abd1-espc6-sensor.yaml
```
```
